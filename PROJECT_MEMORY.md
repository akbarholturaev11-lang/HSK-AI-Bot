## 10. Recent Important Changes

### 2026-05-25 — Course narrative text formatting

Changed:
- Course text blocks with narrator-style lines (`旁白` / no speaker) now render as text instead of dialogue: bold Chinese line, pinyin below, translation below.
- Narrative blocks show `Matn/Текст/Матн` in the course message header instead of `Dialog`.

Why:
- Textbook passages without speakers were hard to read when formatted like dialogue lines.

Files touched:
- `app/bot/utils/course_formatter.py`

Risk:
- This is display-only; stored lesson JSON and progress logic are unchanged.

### 2026-05-25 — Referral trial active access

Changed:
- Users can unlock 3 days of non-paid `active` access after collecting 10 active referrals.
- This reward is separate from the existing referral bonus and referral discount flows: +5 bonus questions and 3-referral discount counters still use their existing fields.
- Referral active access does not set `payment_status=approved`; it creates a fixed $2 AI usage budget for the trial active window.
- In trial active, text/course/photo use the fixed $2 AI budget; photo no longer has a separate daily image limit during this reward window.
- If the fixed $2 AI budget is depleted before 3 days, the non-paid active user is downgraded back to `trial`; if 3 days expire first, the user is also downgraded even if budget remains.
- Voice is restricted to real paid subscribers (`status=active` and `payment_status=approved`); non-paid active windows do not unlock voice.
- Profile labels non-paid active as `Sinov muddati`, shows only referral count, and leaves the subscription line empty unless the user has a real paid subscription.
- A new `users.referral_trial_count_started_at` marker resets this feature's referral count after each 3-day reward window.

Why:
- Trial users need a referral path to temporarily become `active` without replacing a real paid subscription.

Files touched:
- `app/services/referral_service.py`
- `app/services/access_service.py`
- `app/services/ai_usage_budget_service.py`
- `app/services/qa_service.py`
- `app/services/image_qa_service.py`
- `app/services/course_miniapp_result_service.py`
- `app/repositories/referral_repo.py`
- `app/db/models/user.py`

- `app/bot/keyboards/referral.py`
- `app/bot/utils/i18n.py`
- `alembic/versions/0028_referral_trial_activation.py`

Risk:
- Paid users are still identified only by `payment_status=approved`; do not treat `status=active` alone as paid subscription.

Follow-up:
- Run DB migration in deploy environments before relying on referral trial progress display.

### 2026-05-25 — Referral bonus usage is lifetime

Changed:
- Daily trial limit reset now resets only `questions_used`; it does not reset `bonus_questions_used`.
- Referral trial active activation also keeps already-used referral bonus questions spent.

Why:
- Referral +5 questions are a one-time bonus, not a daily renewed allowance.

Files touched:
- `app/services/access_service.py`
- `app/services/referral_service.py`

Risk:
- Users who already reused bonus questions before this fix are not retroactively corrected.

Follow-up:
- If historical correction is required, add a separate data audit instead of mixing it into runtime access logic.

### 2026-05-24 — Dynamic course dialogue audio admin

Changed:
- Admin audio panel now builds required audio types from each lesson's current `dialogue_json` block count, so HSK4 lessons with 5 dialogues show `vocab` plus `dialogue_1` through `dialogue_5`.
- Audio status now distinguishes complete, partial, and missing lessons, and ignores obsolete audio types that no longer match the current lesson format.
- Course audio playback no longer falls back from `dialogue_2+` to `dialogue_1`; missing dialogue-specific audio now stays unavailable instead of playing the wrong old audio.

Why:
- After lessons were split into more dialogue blocks, the old admin/audio logic could hide later dialogues or reuse outdated audio under the wrong dialogue.

Files touched:
- `app/bot/handlers/admin_audio.py`
- `app/bot/handlers/course.py`
- `app/repositories/course_audio_repo.py`
- `app/services/course_engine_service.py`
- `app/services/course_tutor_service.py`

Risk:
- Existing lessons that only have `dialogue_1` uploaded will show missing audio for later dialogue blocks until admin uploads each specific dialogue audio.

Follow-up:
- If obsolete DB audio should be deleted automatically, add an explicit admin cleanup action instead of silently deleting rows.

### 2026-05-24 — HSK4 upper lesson localization quality

Changed:
- HSK4 上 lessons 1-3 now keep PDF-canonical Chinese dialogue/new-word material while adding Uzbek, Russian, and Tajik translations, dialogue pinyin, localized grammar explanations, and localized mini quiz/homework prompts.
- The HSK4 static mini app fallback data now uses language-aware vocabulary, grammar, and quiz strings instead of Uzbek-only strings.

Why:
- Bot course messages and Mini App could show blank or Uzbek-only explanations for Russian/Tajik users because HSK4 seed payload only contained Uzbek fields and empty dialogue pinyin.

Files touched:
- `scripts/hsk4_upper_pdf_materials.py`
- `scripts/hsk4_upper_i18n.py`
- `scripts/verify_hsk4_upper_pdf_materials.py`
- `app/static/hsk4.html`

Risk:
- Dialogue/new words remain source-locked to the textbook data in `scripts/hsk4_upper_pdf_materials.py`; only translations/explanations/pinyin are added in the i18n layer.

Follow-up:
- Use the same localization verifier before enabling HSK4 上 lessons 4-6 in Mini App support.

### 2026-05-24 — Course level completion upgrade flow

Changed:
- When a user finishes the last lesson in a HSK level, the bot now sends a level-completion congratulations message with lesson, vocabulary, dialogue, and study-duration progress.
- The bot then asks whether to move to the next HSK level in Uzbek, Russian, and Tajik. Yes upgrades `users.level`, resets course progress for the next level, and opens lesson 1. No keeps the user on the completed level and shows that level's lesson list.
- Final lessons are now marked completed only once, preventing repeated "next lesson" presses from double-counting progress.

Why:
- The previous final-lesson path only showed a generic "lesson completed" message when no next lesson existed.

Files touched:
- `app/services/course_engine_service.py`
- `app/bot/handlers/course.py`
- `app/bot/handlers/messages.py`
- `app/bot/keyboards/course_context.py`
- `app/bot/utils/i18n.py`

Risk:
- Advancing to the next level resets `CourseProgress.completed_lessons_count` for the new level because the current schema stores one course progress row per user.

Follow-up:
- If global cross-level progress is required later, add a dedicated course completion history table instead of overloading the current per-user progress row.

### 2026-05-24 — Course block AI context

Changed:
- HSK course AI prompts now receive block-level course context for block lessons: dialogue block, block vocabulary, grammar points, mini quiz, and mini homework.
- HSK3 lessons 13-16 were wired through `scripts/hsk3_pdf_materials.py`, so dialogue/new words are PDF canonical instead of synthetic seed content.

Why:
- Mini App quiz/homework review must explain the exact user mistakes using the same block material shown in the course.

Files touched:
- `app/services/course_tutor_service.py`

### 2026-05-24 — HSK3 block lesson completion

Changed:
- HSK3 lessons 17-20 now use PDF canonical dialogue/new-word material through `scripts/hsk3_pdf_materials.py`.
- All HSK3 lessons 1-20 now generate per-dialogue block steps with `block_vocab_N` before `dialogue_N`.

Why:
- Lessons 17-20 were still in the older V2 format, so later parts could start directly with `dialogue_3`/`dialogue_4` and skip the new-word section.

Files touched:
- `scripts/hsk3_pdf_materials.py`
- `scripts/seed_hsk3_lesson_17.py`
- `scripts/seed_hsk3_lesson_18.py`
- `scripts/seed_hsk3_lesson_19.py`
- `scripts/seed_hsk3_lesson_20.py`
- `scripts/verify_hsk3_pdf_materials.py`

Risk:
- Database must run the course seed sync or app restart so existing stored lesson JSON is refreshed.

Follow-up:
- If a deployed bot still shows old HSK3 lesson flow, restart/reseed first before debugging UI step logic.

### 2026-05-24 — Block grammar de-duplication

Changed:
- HSK1, HSK2, and HSK3 block lessons now normalize grammar per lesson so the same book grammar number is not shown repeatedly across multiple blocks.
- Every block still gets a short context grammar note based on the actual dialogue sentence used in that block.
- Telegram formatter and Mini App lesson payload prefer block `grammar_notes` over long book grammar items to avoid duplicate-looking explanations.

Why:
- Users saw repeated grammar material across blocks and some blocks felt like they had no useful grammar.

Files touched:
- `scripts/block_context_grammar.py`
- `scripts/hsk1_block_metadata.py`
- `scripts/hsk2_block_metadata.py`
- `scripts/hsk3_pdf_materials.py`
- `app/bot/utils/course_formatter.py`
- `app/services/course_miniapp_lesson_service.py`
- `app/services/course_tutor_service.py`
- `scripts/verify_course_block_grammar.py`

Risk:
- Existing database lesson JSON must be refreshed by seed sync/app restart before deployed users see the normalized grammar.
- `app/services/course_miniapp_result_service.py`
- `scripts/hsk3_pdf_materials.py`
- `scripts/seed_hsk3_lesson_13.py` to `scripts/seed_hsk3_lesson_16.py`
- `scripts/verify_hsk3_pdf_materials.py`

Why:
- 

Files touched:
- 

Risk:
- 

Follow-up:
- 

### 2026-05-24 — HSK4 上 first 3 lessons block format

Changed:
- HSK4 上 lessons 1-3 now use PDF-derived dialogue and vocabulary material through `scripts/hsk4_upper_pdf_materials.py`.
- Each of those lessons has 5 dialogue blocks, per-block vocabulary, one relevant PDF grammar point, mini quiz, and mini homework.
- HSK4 Mini App support is enabled only for lessons 1-3 for now via `hsk4.html`.

Why:
- HSK4 upper lessons had fewer dialogue blocks than the PDF and some lesson 2/3 grammar/vocabulary was from the wrong older seed format.

Files touched:
- `scripts/hsk4_upper_pdf_materials.py`
- `scripts/seed_hsk4_lesson_01.py` to `scripts/seed_hsk4_lesson_03.py`
- `app/bot/utils/course_miniapp.py`
- `app/static/hsk4.html`

Risk:
- Lessons 4+ are intentionally not enabled in HSK4 Mini App yet; continue in small batches to avoid content errors.

### 2026-05-24 — HSK4 上 lessons 4-6 PDF alignment

Changed:
- HSK4 上 lessons 4-6 now use canonical textbook dialogue/new-word data through `scripts/hsk4_upper_pdf_materials_4_6.py`.
- Each lesson has 5 dialogue blocks, 31 textbook vocabulary items, 5 grammar points, three-language translations, pinyin, per-block mini quiz/homework, and Mini App fallback data.
- Seed files for lessons 4-6 are now thin wrappers so stale non-PDF fallback content cannot leak into runtime data.

Why:
- Lessons 4-6 previously still contained older non-canonical seed material and HSK4 Mini App fallback only covered lessons 1-3.

Files touched:
- `scripts/hsk4_upper_pdf_materials.py`
- `scripts/hsk4_upper_pdf_materials_4_6.py`
- `scripts/seed_hsk4_lesson_04.py` to `scripts/seed_hsk4_lesson_06.py`
- `scripts/verify_hsk4_upper_pdf_materials.py`
- `app/static/hsk4.html`

Risk:
- Database must be reseeded for deployed environments; local DB was updated for HSK4-L04, HSK4-L05, and HSK4-L06 in this session.

### 2026-05-25 — HSK4 上 lessons 7-10 PDF alignment

Changed:
- HSK4 上 lessons 7-10 now use canonical textbook dialogue/new-word data through `scripts/hsk4_upper_pdf_materials_7_10.py`.
- Each lesson has 5 dialogue blocks, per-block vocabulary, one relevant grammar point, three-language translations, pinyin, mini quiz, and mini homework.
- HSK4 static Mini App fallback data now covers lessons 1-10 with grammar-focused quiz questions and no fill-blank style quiz items.

Why:
- Lessons 7-10 still had stale seed JSON and Mini App coverage stopped at lesson 6.

Files touched:
- `scripts/hsk4_upper_pdf_materials.py`
- `scripts/hsk4_upper_pdf_materials_7_10.py`
- `scripts/seed_hsk4_lesson_07.py` to `scripts/seed_hsk4_lesson_10.py`
- `scripts/verify_hsk4_upper_pdf_materials.py`
- `app/static/hsk4.html`

Risk:
- Database must be reseeded for deployed environments; local DB was updated for HSK4-L07 through HSK4-L10 in this session.

### 2026-05-25 — HSK4 下 lessons 11-13 PDF alignment

Changed:
- HSK4 下 lessons 11-13 now use canonical textbook dialogue/new-word data through `scripts/hsk4_lower_pdf_materials.py`.
- Each lesson has 5 blocks, per-block vocabulary, relevant grammar, pinyin, three-language translations, mini quiz, and mini homework.
- HSK4 static Mini App fallback now recognizes lessons 1-13 and includes grammar quiz items for lessons 11-13.

Why:
- HSK4 下 needed to start from the textbook format; older lower seed data had incomplete lesson blocks and stale lesson 11 content.

Files touched:
- `scripts/hsk4_lower_pdf_materials.py`
- `scripts/hsk4_lower_seed_data.py`
- `scripts/seed_hsk4_lesson_11.py`
- `scripts/verify_hsk4_lower_pdf_materials.py`
- `app/static/hsk4.html`

Risk:
- Database must be reseeded for deployed environments; local DB was updated for HSK4-L11 through HSK4-L13 in this session.

### 2026-05-25 — HSK4 Mini App support range

Changed:
- HSK4 Mini App support range is now lessons 1-13.

Why:
- HSK4 上 lessons 4-10 had Mini App content and API payloads, but course buttons were blocked by the stale supported range `1-3`.

Files touched:
- `app/bot/utils/course_miniapp.py`

Risk:
- HSK4 lessons beyond 13 stay unsupported until their lesson data is converted.

### 2026-05-25 — HSK4 下 lessons 14-16 PDF alignment

Changed:
- HSK4 下 lessons 14-16 now use canonical textbook dialogue/new-word data through `scripts/hsk4_lower_pdf_materials_14_16.py`.
- Each lesson has 5 blocks, per-block vocabulary, relevant grammar, pinyin, three-language translations, mini quiz, and mini homework generated through the lower seed pipeline.
- HSK4 static Mini App fallback and support range now cover lessons 1-16 with grammar-focused quiz items and no blank-fill quiz format.

Why:
- Lessons 14-16 needed the same PDF-based format as lessons 11-13 before continuing HSK4 下 in small batches.

Files touched:
- `scripts/hsk4_lower_pdf_materials.py`
- `scripts/hsk4_lower_pdf_materials_14_16.py`
- `scripts/verify_hsk4_lower_pdf_materials.py`
- `app/bot/utils/course_miniapp.py`
- `app/static/hsk4.html`

Risk:
- Runtime database must be reseeded or app restarted in deployed environments before Telegram course messages show HSK4-L14 through HSK4-L16.

### 2026-05-28 — HSK4 下 lessons 17-20 PDF alignment

Changed:
- HSK4 下 lessons 17-20 now use canonical textbook dialogue/new-word data through `scripts/hsk4_lower_pdf_materials_17_20.py`.
- Each lesson has 5 blocks, per-block vocabulary, relevant grammar, pinyin, three-language translations, mini quiz, and mini homework generated through the lower seed pipeline.
- HSK4 static Mini App fallback and support range now cover lessons 1-20 with grammar-focused quiz items and no blank-fill quiz format.

Why:
- Lessons 17-20 complete HSK4 下 in the same PDF-based format as lessons 11-16.

Files touched:
- `scripts/hsk4_lower_pdf_materials.py`
- `scripts/hsk4_lower_pdf_materials_17_20.py`
- `scripts/verify_hsk4_lower_pdf_materials.py`
- `app/bot/utils/course_miniapp.py`
- `app/static/hsk4.html`

Risk:
- Runtime database must be reseeded or app restarted in deployed environments before Telegram course messages show HSK4-L17 through HSK4-L20.

### 2026-06-04 — Localized admin messaging and TJS card subscriptions

Changed:
- Admin broadcast and ad campaign text can be written once in Tajik, then localized to TJ/UZ/RU through AI before sending; users receive the variant matching their language.
- Broadcast and ad campaign confirm flows include an admin test send without clearing the prepared message.
- Visa/Card subscription pricing is TJS-only: 10 days = 29 TJS, 1 month = 89 TJS by default. Alipay/WeChat remain in yuan.
- Stale checkout drafts are recalculated when a screenshot arrives so old USD drafts do not survive after the TJS switch.
- Expired admin/feedback discount buttons edit the original offer message to an expired text instead of only showing an alert.

Why:
- Admins should not send separate messages per language, and card subscription revenue should be priced in somoni.

Files touched:
- `app/services/broadcast_translation_service.py`
- `app/bot/handlers/admin_broadcast.py`
- `app/bot/handlers/admin_ads.py`
- `app/services/ad_campaign_service.py`
- `app/services/subscription_price_service.py`
- `app/bot/handlers/subscription.py`
- `app/services/payment_service.py`

Risk:
- Broadcast/ad translations depend on `OPENAI_API_KEY`; if translation fails, the Tajik source is used as a safe fallback.
- Telegram bot updates do not expose user IP, so non-TJ card users see a general bank-rate TJS payment note instead of IP-based country detection.
